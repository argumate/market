# Market

The market determines the probability of future events by aggregating the
activity of players trading conditional IOUs.

## IOUs

An IOU is a debt for a specified amount that the issuer owes the holder. The
holder of an IOU can unilaterally transfer it to be held by someone else,
either in its entirety or partially by splitting it into several IOUs that sum
to the same amount as the original. Transferring an IOU back to the issuer is
equivalent to voiding it.

IOUs have no maturity date and do not require interest payments. IOUs are
denominated in US dollars, but there is no obligation on the issuer to ever
actually redeem them for US dollars, or indeed for anything else, although
they are free to do so if they wish.

A market player can issue an arbitrary number of IOUs of arbitrary amounts,
however other players may value their IOUs more cheaply if they judge that
they have issued too many.

## Conditions

IOUs can be conditional, in which case they are considered void if the
condition does not hold. This allows players to make predictions about future
events by trading IOUs which are conditional on those events taking place.

For example, someone might create an IOU that has the condition "Donald Trump
will win the 2020 election" and trade it in exchange for an IOU contingent on
the opposite condition, if they believe that to be more likely. These IOUs
could specify different amounts, to reflect the different probabilities that
each player has estimated for this event. Once the election takes place and
the outcome is revealed, one of the IOUs will be void and the other will not.
