# Market

The market determines the probability of future events by aggregating the
activity of players trading conditional IOUs.

## IOUs

An IOU is a debt for a specified amount that the issuer owes the holder. The
holder of an IOU can unilaterally transfer it to someone else, either in its
entirety or by splitting it into several smaller IOUs that sum to the same
amount as the original. Transferring an IOU back to the issuer is equivalent
to voiding or cancelling it as players cannot hold debt issued by themselves.

IOUs have no maturity date and do not require interest payments. IOUs are
denominated in US dollars, but the issuer has no legal obligation to actually
redeem them for US dollars, or indeed for anything else, although they are
free to do so if they wish.

Players can issue an arbitrary number of IOUs of arbitrary amounts, however
other players may consider the IOUs to be less valuable if they believe that
the issuer has issued too many, or is likely to do so in the future.

## Conditions

IOUs can be conditional, in which case they are considered void if the
condition does not hold. This allows players to make predictions about future
events by trading IOUs which are conditional on those events taking place.

For example, someone might create an IOU that has the condition "Donald Trump
will win the 2020 election" and trade it in exchange for an IOU contingent on
the opposite condition, if they believe that to be more likely. These IOUs
could specify different amounts, to reflect the different probabilities that
each player has estimated for this event. Once the election takes place and
the outcome is revealed, one of the IOUs will be void and the other will not.
